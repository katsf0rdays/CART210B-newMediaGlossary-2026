## Automation vs Agency

Let’s first break down the two terms.

Automation, first coined by Delmer S. Harder, the Vice President of Manufacturing at the Ford Motor Company in 1946, is defined in the dictionary as “the technique of making an apparatus, a process or a system operate automatically”. It is also defined by the International Society of Automation as "the creation and application of technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products and services.”[^isaautomation]

Agency, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, and in this context, is seen as “the capacity, condition or state of acting or of exerting power” or “a person or thing through which power is exerted or an end is achieved.”[^merriam-websteragency] It is the ability to make meaningful decisions and to have control over one’s path.[^krastev25preserve] 

In the context of the present tense media and the era of Artificial Intelligence, automation is associated with AI, as is an automatic operating system, a “creation”, an “application of technology” that does wired tasks. It executes what it is programmed to do and that is the end of its function. Automation  involves AI systems taking over tasks that humans have previously performed.[^krakowski25human] It has no sense of uniqueness nor does it have any feelings or personality to personalize its actions or responses. However, it is also undeniable that AI is likely to make human work more productive in current existing tasks but at the same time, has the capacity to create new tasks that require human skills which can not be replicated by AI.[^tyson-zysman22automation] 

That sort of “power” is not granted to AI like it is to humans. In this day and age, where AI excels in efficiency as an automated entity, it lacks agency and will always deliver a non-felt response to the user through its interactions. To have agency is to have the capacity to exert power over something, someone or oneself. One might use automation to execute tasks, for example sending emails, create flowcharts etc, however those are implementation details, not the value proposition. The agency of one’s action lies in the reasoning that decides whether one should send said email, what should be said and who to send the email to.[^priyanka25automation]
